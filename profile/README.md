# Welcome to our GitHub Org for our Local Toronto PHP Groups

My name is Bob Bloom. I am the lead organizer of:
- Greater Toronto Area (GTA) PHP Group [(https://www.meetup.com/gta-php-user-group-toronto/)](https://www.meetup.com/gta-php-user-group-toronto/)
- York Region PHP Group [(https://www.meetup.com/york-region-php-user-group/)](https://www.meetup.com/york-region-php-user-group/)
- Laravel Toronto [(https://www.meetup.com/laravel-toronto/)](https://www.meetup.com/laravel-toronto/)

In lieu of doing websites for each of our three groups, I am doing this GitHub organization as a website proxy. 

I am a bit amazed that after searching for a quick way to do websites, I could not find a solution. 

Hugo, and other static site generators, were promising, but judging by my reticence gettting into the weeds of it, I demurred.

I have been creating repos to do notes for specific meet-ups. It is handy to be able to edit something regardless of where I am or what device I am using. And, of course, our attendees are very used to GitHub. And, why not do PR's for contributions? 

I have a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXgN_ee2MsFKWqHgS-Pv3Vz515RRAjdLh) for our Groups, mainly uploading updates from time to time (latest one on [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_MVtG_HCqw). My video summary of our January 25, 2024 meet-up at Microsoft is at [https://github.com/local-toronto-php-groups/2024january25_meetup_gta-php](https://github.com/local-toronto-php-groups/2024january25_meetup_gta-php).
